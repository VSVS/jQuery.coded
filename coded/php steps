php file

include our db file for db functions - this INLCUDES the file you're linking to in the file you're currently in

extract request header parameters-getting info from the application and setting them to varibles

validate request header parameters

start session-allows us to view session information(this is the step before to see if the user is logged in)

validate the session varibles-if the session varibles are blank you are not signed in-if the session varible is set than the user is logged in

logic-based on the sign in user-typically query the database

echo a json response to our application

return-end everything
